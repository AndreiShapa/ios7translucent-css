## How to help?

You need to have nodejs and ruby for compass/sass

  1. Fork this Repo
  2. `npm install`
  3. `grunt dev` will open the `src/index.html` in your default browser


## Where is it working?

This is currently working in
  * Chrome 29+ (enable  'experimental-webkit-features'/'enable-experimental-web-platform-features')
  * Safari 6.1 beta
  * Mobile Safari on iOS7, scrolling is working. But **no inertial scrolling**
